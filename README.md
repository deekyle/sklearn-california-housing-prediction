# sklearn-california-housing-prediction
The created model should learn from the given data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.
Note that this model was referenced by the author Aurélien Géron, "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow".  This source allowed
myself to use my mathematic skills to create a prediction model of a given data set.
